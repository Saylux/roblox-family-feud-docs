# Periodic & Autonomous AI Processes

This document defines a set of periodic and autonomous processes that AI agents should perform to continuously improve the Roblox Family Feud project. These processes are designed to be run by one or more AI agents, either on a schedule or in response to project events.

## Codebase Review & Refactoring
- Review all code for style, duplication, and outdated patterns.
- Refactor code to improve readability, maintainability, and performance.
- Remove unused code, assets, and dependencies.
- Prompt: "AI, review the codebase for refactoring opportunities and generate a summary of recommended changes."

## Documentation Update & Cross-Linking
- Ensure all documentation is up to date and cross-linked.
- Add missing references, update diagrams, and clarify ambiguous sections.
- Prompt: "AI, review all documentation for outdated or missing information and update as needed."

## Cost Optimization
- Review all tool and service costs for accuracy and necessity.
