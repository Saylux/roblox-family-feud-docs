# Peer Review â€“ Version Control

## Tech Lead Review Comments
- [2024-07-21] Tech Lead: The toolchain (Git, Rojo, Foreman, etc.) is robust, but are there onboarding or cross-platform issues for new contributors?
- [2024-07-21] Tech Lead: How do we ensure all contributors use the same tool versions and avoid "works on my machine" problems?
- [2024-07-21] Tech Lead: Is the asset pipeline (Asphalt, Lune) too complex for the project's scale?

## Staff Software Engineer Responses
- [2024-07-21] Staff SE: We provide a one-command setup script and clear onboarding docs. Foreman/Rokit enforce tool versions.
- [2024-07-21] Staff SE: CI checks will fail if tool versions drift; contributors are prompted to update.
- [2024-07-21] Staff SE: Asset pipeline complexity is justified for future scalability, but we will monitor and simplify if it becomes a bottleneck.

## Action Log
- [2024-07-21] Added onboarding script and documentation.
- [2024-07-21] CI now checks tool versions on every PR.
