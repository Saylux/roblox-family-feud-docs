# Decision: Autonomous AI Agent Framework

**Selected Framework:** CrewAI

## Rationale
- **Ease of Setup:** CrewAI is the simplest to install and configure for new users.
- **Debuggability:** It provides clear logging, error messages, and a growing set of examples.
- **Effectiveness:** CrewAI supports multi-agent workflows, task orchestration, and is actively maintained.
- **Community:** While not as large as LangChain, CrewAI's community is growing and responsive.
- **Onboarding:** Minimal code required to get started; good for rapid prototyping and automation.

## Alternatives Considered
- **LangChain:** More complex, better for advanced use cases, but overkill for most Roblox/CI/CD needs.
- **AutoGen:** Good for conversational agents, but less focused on workflow orchestration.
- **MetaGPT, SuperAGI, OpenAgents:** Less mature, smaller communities, or more difficult to debug.

## Conclusion
CrewAI is the best fit for this project due to its balance of simplicity, power, and ease of debugging. If project needs change, revisit this decision.
