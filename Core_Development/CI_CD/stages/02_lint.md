# Lint Stage

## Purpose
- Run code quality checks, linters, and formatters to enforce coding standards and prevent errors.

## Automation
- Automatically run Selene, StyLua, and any other linters/formatters on every commit or pull request.
- Block merges if linting fails.

## AI-Driven Improvements
- AI reviews linting results and suggests code style improvements.
- AI can auto-fix simple linting issues and document changes.
- AI tracks recurring lint issues and recommends training or documentation updates.
