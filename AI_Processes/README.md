# AI Processes

This section documents all autonomous, periodic, and collaborative processes that AI agents perform to improve, maintain, and optimize the Roblox Family Feud project. It is designed for a future where multiple AI agents work together, continuously reviewing, refactoring, and enhancing every aspect of the project.

## Subfolders
- `plan/`: Process definitions, improvement playbooks, and AI self-review logs.
- `tools/`: Scripts, APIs, and frameworks for orchestrating and automating AI-driven processes.

## Example AI Processes
- Periodic codebase review and refactoring
- Automated documentation updates and cross-linking
- Cost optimization and tool/service review
- Ad campaign performance analysis and adjustment
- Test coverage and flaky test detection
- Peer (AI) review and self-critique
- Security and secret management audits
- Player feedback and analytics-driven improvement

## How to Use
- Define new AI processes in the `plan/` subfolder.
- Add or update automation scripts and orchestration tools in the `tools/` subfolder.
- Use this section as the coordination hub for all AI-driven project improvement activities.
