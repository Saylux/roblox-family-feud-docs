# Peer Review â€“ Prototyping

## Tech Lead Review Comments
- [2024-07-21] Tech Lead: The current prototyping stack is fast, but relies heavily on Studio and AI tools that may generate suboptimal or unreviewed code. Is there a risk of accumulating technical debt or inconsistent code quality?
- [2024-07-21] Tech Lead: Studio Lite is great for accessibility, but does it meaningfully contribute to professional workflows, or does it risk fragmenting the prototyping process?
- [2024-07-21] Tech Lead: Are there any gaps in rapid UI prototyping, especially for more complex Family Feud interfaces?

## Staff Software Engineer Responses
- [2024-07-21] Staff SE: We mitigate AI-generated code risks by requiring all scripts to be reviewed before integration. We can add a linting/formatting step to the workflow to enforce standards.
- [2024-07-21] Staff SE: Studio Lite is primarily for onboarding and quick mobile tests; it is not used for mainline prototyping, so fragmentation risk is low.
- [2024-07-21] Staff SE: For complex UI, we should consider integrating Roact or similar frameworks into the prototyping stack for more robust, testable UI components.

## Action Log
- [2024-07-21] Added linting/formatting step to prototyping workflow.
- [2024-07-21] Clarified Studio Lite's role in documentation.
- [2024-07-21] Added Roact evaluation to UI prototyping tools backlog.
