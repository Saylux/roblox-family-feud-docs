# Deploy Stage

## Purpose
- Deploy build artifacts to Roblox or other environments.
- Ensure deployments are safe, reliable, and traceable.

## Automation
- Automatically deploy after successful build, lint, test, and package stages.
- Use scripts or APIs to publish to Roblox, update assets, or trigger post-deploy hooks.

## AI-Driven Improvements
- AI monitors deployment logs for errors or anomalies.
- AI can roll back or retry failed deployments.
- AI documents all deployments and notifies of success/failure. 

> **Note:** True canary deployments (where only a subset of live users receive the new version) are not possible on Roblox. All published updates are immediately live for everyone. For safer deployments, use a test place or private copy for validation before publishing to production, and automate thorough end-to-end playtesting.
