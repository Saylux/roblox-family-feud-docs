# Peer Review â€“ End-to-End Playtesting

## Tech Lead Review Comments
- [2024-07-21] Tech Lead: Are agent-based simulations realistic enough to catch real player issues, or do they miss emergent gameplay bugs?
- [2024-07-21] Tech Lead: Is there a risk of scenario scripts becoming brittle as the game evolves?
- [2024-07-21] Tech Lead: How do we ensure playtesting covers edge cases and rare failure modes?

## Staff Software Engineer Responses
- [2024-07-21] Staff SE: We periodically review and update agent behaviors based on real player data and feedback.
- [2024-07-21] Staff SE: Scenario scripts are versioned and refactored alongside game changes; we use parameterized tests to reduce brittleness.
- [2024-07-21] Staff SE: Edge cases are tracked in a test matrix and prioritized for automated playtesting.

## Action Log
- [2024-07-21] Added player data review to agent simulation process.
- [2024-07-21] Established test matrix for edge case coverage.
