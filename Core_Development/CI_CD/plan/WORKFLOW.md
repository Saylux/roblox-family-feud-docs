# CI/CD Workflow: Secrets, Fallback, and Automation Review

## Secret Management & Rotation
- All secrets (API keys, tokens) are stored in GitHub Actions secrets.
- Secrets are never committed to source control.
- Rotate secrets every 90 days or after any security incident.
- Document rotation in the Action Log (see Peer_Review.md).

## Fallback Procedures
- Critical pipeline steps (build, deploy) have retry logic and fallback scripts.
- Outages are monitored; fallback steps are triggered automatically if a tool/API is down.

## Periodic Automation Review
- Every quarter, review the pipeline for new automation opportunities.
- Log findings and improvements in Peer_Review.md Action Log.
