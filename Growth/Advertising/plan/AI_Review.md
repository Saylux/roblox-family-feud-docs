# AI Review – Advertising & Growth

## AI Critique Prompts
- Are the current ad strategies leveraging the latest Roblox ad formats and meta?
- Is the AI generating ad copy and creative assets that are optimized for Roblox's audience and trends?
- Are campaign results being analyzed and iterated on by the AI for continuous improvement?
- Is there any manual step in ad placement or monitoring that could be further automated?

## AI Self-Review (Example)

- [2024-07-21] AI: Ad copy is generated using recent Roblox meme trends, but should be A/B tested for CTR.
- [2024-07-21] AI: Monitoring is automated, but campaign adjustment is still manual—consider scripting budget reallocation based on real-time performance.

## Action Log
