# Onboarding & Setup Instructions

## Quick Start
1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `./setup.sh` (or `setup.bat` on Windows) to install all required tools via Foreman/Rokit.
3. Follow prompts to complete environment setup.

## Tool Version Enforcement
- Foreman/Rokit ensures all contributors use the same tool versions.
- CI will fail if tool versions drift; update instructions are provided in the error message.

## Troubleshooting
- See the README or contact the team for help with setup issues.
