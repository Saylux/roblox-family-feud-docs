# AI Review – Developer Setup

## AI Critique Prompts
- Is the onboarding checklist fully automated, or are there manual steps that could be scripted?
- Are all required tools and accounts documented and easy for the AI to configure?
- Is the setup process robust to environment changes (OS, updates, etc.)?
- Are there any recurring setup issues that the AI could detect and resolve automatically?

## AI Self-Review (Example)
- [2024-07-21] AI: The setup script covers all core tools, but secret management is still manual—consider integrating secret manager APIs.
- [2024-07-21] AI: Account creation is documented, but could be further streamlined with pre-filled forms or automation links.
- [2024-07-21] AI: No recurring setup issues detected in the last three onboarding runs.

## Action Log
- [2024-07-21] Added secret manager integration to setup script backlog.
- [2024-07-21] Added automation links for account creation.
