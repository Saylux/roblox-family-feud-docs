# AI Review – AI Processes

## AI Critique Prompts
- Are all periodic and autonomous AI processes being executed as defined?
- Are there any processes that could be further automated or improved?
- Is the AI effectively coordinating between different sections (e.g., cost, ads, codebase)?
- Are findings and actions being logged and acted upon in each section's AI_Review?
- Are new AI capabilities or project needs being incorporated into the process list?

## AI Self-Review (Example)
- [2024-07-21] AI: All defined processes are being executed, but codebase review could be more frequent after major refactors.
- [2024-07-21] AI: Documentation cross-linking is mostly automated, but diagram updates are still manual—consider integrating diagram generation tools.
- [2024-07-21] AI: Cost optimization review identified an unused asset hosting subscription, which was cancelled.

## Action Log
- [2024-07-21] Increased codebase review frequency after major changes.
- [2024-07-21] Added diagram generation tool evaluation to backlog.
- [2024-07-21] Cancelled unused asset hosting subscription.
