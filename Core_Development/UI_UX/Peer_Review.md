# Peer Review: UI/UX Tools & Documentation

## Tech Lead Review comments
- **Strengths:**
  - UI/UX tool documentation covers all major frameworks and libraries (Roact, Fusion, Rodux, Flipper).
  - Decision file clearly explains the rationale for tool selection.
  - Documentation format is consistent and professional.
- **Major Criticisms/Downfalls:**
  - Some files could benefit from more real-world usage examples and code snippets.
  - No Key Links or source references in some files, which reduces verifiability.
  - No README files for subcategories (if any are added in the future).
  - No visual overview of how UI/UX tools interact or are composed in a typical project.
