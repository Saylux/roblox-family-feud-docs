# End-to-End Playtesting Workflow: Agent Simulation & Edge Case Coverage

## Player Data Review for Agent Simulation
- After each major release, collect anonymized player session data.
- Analyze player behaviors, edge cases, and failure modes.
- Update agent simulation scripts to better reflect real player actions and strategies.
- Document changes in Peer_Review.md Action Log.

## Test Matrix for Edge Case Coverage
- Maintain a test matrix (see TEST_MATRIX.md) to track scenario and edge case coverage.
- Review and update the matrix at each milestone.
- Prioritize edge cases and rare failure modes for automated playtesting.
