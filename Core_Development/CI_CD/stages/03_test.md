# Test Stage

## Purpose
- Execute all automated tests (unit, integration, scenario, and sanity checks) to ensure code correctness and prevent regressions.

## Automation
- Run the full test suite (TestEZ, Jest-Roblox, etc.) on every commit or pull request.
- Block merges if any test fails.
- AI generates new tests for uncovered code or features.

## AI-Driven Improvements
- AI analyzes test coverage and identifies gaps.
- AI detects flaky tests and quarantines them for review.
- AI proposes or implements fixes for failing tests.
- AI logs all test results and actions for review.
