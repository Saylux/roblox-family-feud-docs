# Prototyping Decision

## Summary
This document summarizes the chosen tools and approaches for rapid prototyping, scripting, UI, and iteration in Roblox Family Feud development.

- **Primary Tool:** Roblox Studio (with Assistant, AI tools, and plugins)
- **Supporting Tools:** Studio Master, RobloxGPT.app, Studio Lite (for mobile/quick prototyping)
- **Rationale:** These tools offer the fastest feedback loop, robust scripting, and UI capabilities, and are widely supported in the Roblox developer ecosystem.

**Planned Improvement:**
- Evaluate Roact or similar UI frameworks for more robust, testable Family Feud UI prototyping (see Peer_Review.md action log).
