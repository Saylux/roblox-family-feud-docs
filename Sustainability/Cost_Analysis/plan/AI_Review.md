# AI Review â€“ Cost Analysis

## AI Critique Prompts
- Are all tool and service costs up to date and tracked in the cost breakdown?
- Is the AI regularly reviewing for cheaper or more automated alternatives?
- Are there any unused subscriptions or services that could be cancelled?
- Is the advertising budget being optimized based on campaign performance?

## AI Self-Review (Example)

- [2024-07-21] AI: No unused subscriptions detected.
- [2024-07-21] AI: Advertising budget reallocated to higher-performing campaigns last month.

## Action Log
