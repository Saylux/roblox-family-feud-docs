# Build Stage

## Purpose
- Compile, bundle, or otherwise prepare all code and assets for testing and deployment.
- Ensure the build is reproducible and consistent across environments.

## Automation
- Run build scripts (e.g., Rojo build, asset bundling) automatically on every commit or pull request.
- Use AI to detect and resolve build errors, and to optimize build scripts for speed and reliability.

## AI-Driven Improvements
- AI reviews build logs for errors and inefficiencies.
- AI suggests or applies optimizations (e.g., parallelization, caching).
- AI documents any changes or issues in the build process.
