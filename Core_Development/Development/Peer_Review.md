# Peer Review: Development Tools & Documentation

## Tech Lead Review comments
- **Strengths:**
  - Tool documentation is now comprehensive, well-organized, and categorized for easy navigation.
  - Addition of Key Links in every file increases accountability and verifiability.
  - Subfolders (testing, events, game_logic, automation, infrastructure, editor) reflect real-world development concerns and workflows.
- **Major Criticisms/Downfalls:**
  - Some tool files were initially missing Key Links or source references, which could have led to trust or onboarding issues.
  - The process for moving and categorizing files was iterative and could be streamlined in the future.
  - README files for each subcategory are missing, which would help with onboarding and quick reference.
  - No cross-linking between related tools (e.g., Rojo and Wally, Signal and Knit) to show how they work together in practice.
  - No visual overview (diagram or table) of the tool ecosystem and their relationships.

## Staff Software Engineer comments
- **Responses:**
  - Key Links have now been added to all tool files for full accountability.
  - All tool files are now in the correct subfolders, and the structure is ready for further refinement.
  - Will add README files for each subcategory to improve onboarding and navigation.
  - Plan to add cross-links and a visual diagram to show tool relationships and workflows.
- **Action Items:**
  - [ ] Add README files to each subcategory folder.
  - [ ] Add cross-links between related tool files.
  - [ ] Create a visual diagram (Mermaid or similar) of the tool ecosystem.
  - [ ] Review and streamline the file organization process for future changes.
