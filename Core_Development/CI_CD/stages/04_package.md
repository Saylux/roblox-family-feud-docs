# Package Stage

## Purpose
- Package build artifacts for deployment or distribution (e.g., .rbxl files, asset bundles).
- Ensure all necessary files are included and versioned.

## Automation
- Automatically package artifacts after a successful build and test.
- Use versioning and checksums to ensure artifact integrity.

## AI-Driven Improvements
- AI reviews package contents for completeness and correctness.
- AI suggests optimizations (e.g., asset deduplication, compression).
- AI documents package versions and changes.
